  ## Feature list
  * denotes on my to do for the project
  2.5 days = 20 hours

  A music composition and production analyst app where you can set BPM, time signature, chord progressions, number of bars, structure and instruments and the app will display a visual representation of the song. Song data will be stored, and new songs can be added.



  ### difficulty scale 1-10. 1 meaning it's already finished 10 meaning what?!?!

  5 = 3 hours
  7 = 5 hours
  10 = full day + ??

  Add variables for each piece of the data that a song requires (BPM, time signature, chord progression, number of bars, instruments) so users can input (5)
  Create a list of song structure parts(chorus, verse, bridge, ...) so users can divide bars with its corresponding structure part. (3)
  Store information given by user (5)
  Create a visual representation of the data (probably a table with columns and rows, where columns will be the bars of the song, and rows the instruments) (9)
  Return and display basic info (Artist name, Album, song title, song duration) (1)
  Style (7)

  Extra:
  Make the Table manipulable (??);
